Hey there this is my first project on backend development and i am very happy for it.
I would like to thank freecodecamp for there amazing free tutorials, this is not a promotiion but my genuine feeling. Ive completed my course online from John Smilga (Coding Addicts), i freakin love that dude.
Ive worked on node.js, express and mongoDB for this small project. Ive learnt to about handling routes, errors, query parameters how to work with them on the backend side, API's , noSQL database(mongoDB) how to create cluster and connect it to my server, mongoose and there in built features it really amazing.
Please feel free to review my code and lemmme know on how i can improve.
Thank YOU :)
